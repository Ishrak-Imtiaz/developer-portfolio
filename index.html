            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio. I am Ishrak Mohammad Imtiaz from Cox'sBazar. I have completed B.Sc in Computer
                Science and Engineering and now I am studying in M.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from
                IIUC. I was
                involved in numerous extra-curricular activities throughout my entire student life, like debate, scout,
                BNCC, cultural programs, travelling,sports etc. All sorts of creative or innovative activities attract
                me
                since those early school days. Now I am learning and mastering web developement. I will not stop until I
                become the Web Developement Hero.</p>
